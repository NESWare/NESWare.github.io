title: About
---fm---

I started NESWare without much of a plan for making a video game (I still plan on doing this, but it needs to be done right!), but found that it serves better as a means for me to talk about my work. Academically I am a mathematician, but professionally have been a software engineer since 2013. Throughout my career I have worked mostly in defense, with some small dabbling in finance. I have experience in modeling and simulation, data engineering, data visualization, software ergonomics, and software education.
