title: geno
tagline: A static-site-generator based on `Panel` by `HoloViz`
---fm---

`geno` is my attempt at writing a static-site-generator. I was pretty tired of trying to work with Jekyll, mostly because I would go too long inbetween writing content that my environment would break in a number of ways. After spending a minimal amount of time with Hugo, I decided to lean into what I know, and use `Panel`!

There is a lot to work through to make `geno` a tool for everyone, but it can already do some impressive things! We can write entire pages as `panel` applications and convert them to run as `pyodide` applications!

I'll update this later once development of `geno` moves to its own repository.
