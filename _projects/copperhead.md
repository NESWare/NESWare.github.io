[`copperhead`](https://github.com/Lnk2past/copperhead) is a dynamic code generator that allows C++ code blocks to be written and executed within Python. Ultimately the code is wrapped and built into a module using setuptools. copperhead is great for prototyping and "what-if" exploration. I would not necessarily recommend using it directly for production code and environments, but it is something that can aid in developing production/release grade modules and libraries.

While development is currently mostly inactive, the project is still alive!
