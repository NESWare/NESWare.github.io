War cuts through the Geoverse as the Hedra and Quadrics fight for spatial dominance. The Hedra are rigid and wear their faces upon sharp edges and vertices. Their constructions are strong and can withstand heavy assaults. The Quadrics are elegant and smooth as they sweep through spacetime. They are agile as well as immaculately precise. The two geometries fight relentlessly, aiming to claim as much of the Geoverse as they can.

However, new geometries have emerged that threaten both the Hedra and Quadrics alike. The Fractal are a rogue geometry that are forcefully consuming the Geoverse. They do not abide by the same axioms as the Hedra and Quadrics, and are mysteriously formidable foes.
