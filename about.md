# Welcome to NESWare!

I started NESWare without much of a plan for making a video game, but found that it serves better as a means for me to talk about my work. Academically I am a mathematician, but professionally have been a software engineer since 2013. In my relatively short career I have had opportunities to work in various disciplines ranging from modeling and simulation to DevOps to software education.

I love coding; I love tinkering; I love making things. Most of all, I love sharing knowledge and helping others learn. NESWare will be a means for me to do all of this. Thanks for stopping by, I hope you learned something from your visit!
